                        We don't work with freelancers. All our designers are hired inâ€‘house.

                        How do you hire designers?
                    </p>
                    <p class="font__style--content02">
                        We hire designers with web design experience. They all have amazing portfolios and social skills
                        that allow them to work productively in a team. <br> <br>
                        We only hire people with a good knowledge of spoken English and a desire to learn. Once hired,
                        new
                        designers go through our training program which teaches them new skills and approaches in SaaS
                        app
                        design. They can start working on a project only after they complete our monthly training. <br>
                        <br>
                        During project development, designers collaborate with one another, get their works reviewed by
                        peers, brainstorm new ideas, and help each other solve problems and create better solutions.

                    <p class="font__style--content02">
                        We adjust our schedules to our client's time zone as much as we can. Our work hours can extend
                        from
                        8 am to 8 pm EEST. We do our best to find overlaps and run productive team meetings even if our
                        client is located in Australia.

                        Our design price is defined by the number of hours we need to make it. <br><br>
                        More designers equal more hours. So no, you don't pay extra for more people. You pay more for
                        more
                        hours.

                        Sure, but do let us know about it beforehand. If you have a monthly subscription, let us know
                        that
                        you want to cancel your project a month before that. If you have weekly sprints, give us a
                        cancellation notice a week before.
